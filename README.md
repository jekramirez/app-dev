# Favorite Series

My favorite series is an anime called **Mob Psycho 100**. It is about a emotionless young boy with overpowered powers that wants to leave a normal life. In this anime we follow his daily life of fighting, developing new emotion, fun, and struggles. As of now, series is at its final arc and almost at its end. So If you have a mind of an old man who just wants to sit and watch kids grow by themselves this anime is perfect for you!
